ðŸŽ¨ PLACE YOUR APP ICON HERE
============================

To add your custom app icon:

1. Save your logo as "icon.png" (512x512 pixels recommended)
2. Place it in this folder: /app/frontend/assets/icon.png
3. For best results, also create:
   - icon.ico (for Windows)
   - icon.icns (for macOS)
4. Delete this text file
5. Run the BUILD_INSTALLER script

Your icon will appear on users' desktops and in their applications folder!
