# 🦸‍♂️ IT Hero Desktop Build - FINAL WORKING VERSION

## 🔧 **BOTH ISSUES FIXED:**

### ✅ **Issue 1: Runtime Error Fixed**
- Fixed electron main file path in package.json
- Fixed file inclusion in build process

### ✅ **Issue 2: Icon Problem Fixed**
- Icon files now properly included in build
- Build process will use YOUR icon from assets folder

## 📍 **YOUR ICON LOCATION:**
Place your icon file here: `frontend/assets/icon.png`
- **Size**: Minimum 256x256 pixels (512x512 recommended)
- **Format**: PNG file
- **Replace**: The existing icon.png file with YOUR icon

## 🚀 **BUILD COMMANDS (Use These Exact Commands):**

```cmd
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
npm install electron electron-builder express --save-dev
npx electron-builder --win --publish=never
```

## 📁 **Your Files Will Be In:**
- `frontend/dist/IT-Hero Setup 1.0.0.exe` (Windows installer)
- `frontend/dist/win-unpacked/IT-Hero.exe` (Direct executable)

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:**
1. Replace the icon.png file with YOUR icon BEFORE building
2. The generated icon was created because the build process resized the placeholder
3. After you replace icon.png with yours, rebuild and it will use YOUR icon

## 🔄 **If You Already Built:**
1. Delete the `frontend/dist` folder
2. Replace `frontend/assets/icon.png` with YOUR icon
3. Run the build commands again

The runtime error is fixed. The icon will be yours if you replace the icon.png file before building.
