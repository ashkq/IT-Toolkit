## 📝 Important Notes

### System Information Accuracy ⚠️
**Your Privacy & Data:**

- ✅ **When you download and run IT Hero locally**: Shows YOUR actual computer's information (CPU, memory, processes, network stats)
- ✅ **All data stays on your computer**: Nothing is sent to external servers
- ✅ **Your search history is private**: Scan history is stored locally on your device only

**Current Preview Note:** If you're viewing this on a web preview, you're seeing the server's information (Linux system with 62GB RAM). When you download IT Hero, you'll see your actual Windows/Mac/Linux computer's real specs.

### Privacy & Security
- All scanning functions work offline by default
- Optional API keys enhance scanning but are not required
- No personal data is collected or transmitted
- Search history is stored locally on your device only
